This is a collection of some code that I wrote (mostly). I probably copied a
few snippets here and there, and some files might have been from teammates or
friends. Most of them are for solving algorithmic problems. I don't think any
effort has been made to ensure that the code is correct.

Despite the purported git history, most of the code is probably written before
2004.
