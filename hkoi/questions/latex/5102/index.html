<h2>
Problem
</h2>

<p>The values of uppercase alphabets A, B, C, ..., Z are assigned to be 1, 2, 3, ..., 26 respectively. The values of lower alphabets a, b, c, ..., z are assigned to be 27, 28, 29, ..., 52 respectively.

<p>An extended lovely string (XLS) is a string that meets all of the following requirements:
<ul><li>It consists entirely of uppercase and/or lowercase alphabets.</li>
<li>It consists of at least one character.</li>
<li>The inequality<br>
<i>v</i><sub>1</sub> x 9 <= <i>v</i><sub>2</sub> x 8<br>
holds for any two adjacent characters, where <i>v</i><sub>1</sub> is the value of the former character and <i>v</i><sub>2</sub> is the value of the latter character.<br></li>
</ul>

<p>For example, De is an XLS, but EF is not an XLS.

<p>Candy has a lexicon. Her lexicon is the list of all XLS in ascending ASCII order along with their ordinal numbers starting from 1. For example, in the lexicon A is the extended lovely string number 1 and AB is the extended lovely string number 2.

<p>Note: if an XLS is a prefix of another XLS, then the former one appears before the latter one in the lexicon. For example, ABE appears before ABEFG.

<p>However, since she is too lovely, Candy does not know how to look up an XLS in the lexicon. She asks you to write a program that determines the ordinal number of an arbitrary given lovely string. There are no more than 2<sup>31</sup> XLS in the lexicon.

<h2>
Input
</h2>

<p>The input consists of only one line which contains a valid extended lovely string.

<h2>
Output
</h2>

<p>The output consists of only one line which contains the ordinal number of that extended lovely string.
