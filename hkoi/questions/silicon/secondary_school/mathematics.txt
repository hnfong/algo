Back to secondary school mathematics.

You are given a polynomial with a degree of N. Your task is to find all the roots of the polynomial, given the following constraints:

- 1000 >= N > 0
- The polynomial has N real, integral, distinct roots.
- All the coefficients of the polynomial are within the range -2^30 to 2^30

Input:

The first line the input consists of a single integer, N.
The next N+1 lines are the coefficients, from the coefficient from x^n to the constant term of the polynomial.

Output:

Output the roots in ascending order, one on each line.
