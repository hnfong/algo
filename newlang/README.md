# New lang

For practicing and trying out new languages.

Each directory will have a classical/textbook problem, `Problem.md`. There will
also be a set of sample inputs `input[0-9]+.txt` and expected output
`output[0-9]+.txt`. There may be a `TestCases.md` to explain/annotate the test
cases. The Makefile will try to run everything it knows how to run.
